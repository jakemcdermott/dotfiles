# Dotfiles
I try to keep things simple and avoid heavy customization when I can.
That said, there's some configuration updates and additional tooling
that I find helpful. This repo is where I keep track of them.

## Other tools
- [ctrl-p](http://ctrlpvim.github.io/ctrlp.vim/) - A vim plugin for finding and listing files.
- [ack](https://beyondgrep.com/) - Searches a directory of source code for patterns.
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - Filter and transform JSON data 
- [tldr++](https://github.com/isacikgoz/tldr) - I prefer to not memorize CLI args and looking them up interrupts my train of thought. This tool helps avoid both.
